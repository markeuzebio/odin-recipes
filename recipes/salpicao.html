        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook chicken breasts in boiling water until fully cooked, then shred the chicken using a fork or your hands.
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finely grate the carrots and cook the green peas until they are tender. Drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, whole milk or cream, ketchup, yellow mustard, and lemon juice.
                Mix until you have a smooth and creamy dressing. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken, grated carrots, cooked green peas, raisins, and canned corn (if using).
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the creamy dressing over the chicken and vegetable mixture. Gently toss everything together until well coated with
                the dressing. Adjust the seasoning if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the salad and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Just before serving, sprinkle the potato sticks (or chips) over the top of the salad for a delightful crunch.
            </li>
            <li>
                If desired, garnish with fresh parsley or chives for an extra pop of color and flavor.
