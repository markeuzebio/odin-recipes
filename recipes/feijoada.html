                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the black beans thoroughly and soak them in water overnight. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>
                    In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.
                    Add the bacon and cook until it becomes crispy.
                    Add the diced pork shoulder, smoked sausage, smoked pork ribs, and, if using, the diced carne seca.
                    Saut√© until they are browned on all sides.
                </li>
                <li>Add the chopped onions and minced garlic to the pot. Cook until the onions become translucent and fragrant.</li>
                <li>
                    Add the soaked black beans to the pot. Pour in enough water to cover the beans and meats by about 2 inches.
                    Stir in the bay leaves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.
                    Cover the pot and simmer for about 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the beans are tender and the meats are cooked through.
                    Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to keep the beans covered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season the feijoada with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaves.
                    Serve the feijoada hot with white rice, farofa, and collard greens. Garnish with orange slices if desired.
                    Feijoada is a hearty and flavorful Brazilian dish traditionally served at gatherings and celebrations.
                    It's a true representation of Brazilian cuisine, and the combination of beans and various meats creates a delicious and satisfying meal.
                    Enjoy!
