        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is an Italian-origin dish that has become a worldwide culinary classic.
            This delicious recipe consists of layers of lasagna noodles, alternated with a flavorful
            filling made from ground meat, ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, and aromatic seasonings
            such as garlic and basil. Each layer is carefully assembled and then baked in the oven until the cheese
            is melted, and the pasta becomes golden and crispy.

            <li>Olive oil</li>

            <li>Butter (for greasing the baking dish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain them and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic. Sauté until they become translucent. Add the ground beef or Italian sausage and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces. Stir in the tomato sauce and fresh basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and one egg. Mix until well blended.</li>
            <li>Grease a large baking dish with butter. Begin by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish. Then, layer with lasagna noodles. Add a portion of the cheese mixture and spread it evenly. Repeat the process, layering noodles, meat sauce, and cheese mixture until you run out of ingredients. Ensure that the top layer is covered with meat sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired. Slice, serve, and enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
